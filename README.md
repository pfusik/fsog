Fifty Shades of Grey
====================

"Fifty Shades of Grey" is a
[demoscene](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demoscene) production for 
[8-bit Atari computers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atari_8-bit_family).
It presents fifty shades of grey (what a surprise!)
accompanied with 8-channel stereo POKEY tune
in a 827-byte program.
Consider that GTIA, the Atari graphics chip,
supports only sixteen shades of grey.

Use PAL Atari with stereo POKEY and a CRT for best experience.
16 kB of RAM is enough.

If you use the Altirra emulator, please enable:
* System / Video / PAL
* System / Video / Frame blending
* System / Audio / Stereo

"Fifty Shades of Grey" took fourth place in the Atari 8-bit 1 kilobyte intro
competition at [Forever 16 Party](http://www.forever-party.net/).
